I dont think this code works but someone had to do it (aka I asked ChatGPT to do this bs again for me).

Compile and run from root: cobc -x -o src/main src/main.cbl && ./src/main

TODO: Current test example doesnt have valid complex number input parameters. The problem is probably because complex numbers arent implemented in cobol.
